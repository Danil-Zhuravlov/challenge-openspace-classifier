## Personal Situation

At BeCode, I'm part of a diverse group of over 20 students. Early on, we noticed a tendency to stick with familiar faces for group work, leading to our large group splitting into smaller, isolated clusters. This division made it challenging to fully embrace the collaborative and inclusive spirit we valued.

To address this, I developed the OpenSpace Organizer. This program randomly assigns seating to ensure everyone collaborates with each other over time. The goal was simple: to break down the invisible walls that kept us within comfort zones and to encourage new connections.

Since implementing the program, the change has been noticeable. We've started interacting more across the entire group, discovering new perspectives and forging stronger bonds. It's not just about sitting next to someone new; it's about creating a more cohesive and dynamic learning environment where everyone feels part of a unified team.

This tool is a testament to how a small shift in our daily routine can significantly impact our collective experience, making our group not just a collection of individuals but a closely-knit community.
